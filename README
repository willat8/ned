Revision control for NED python scripting

Requirements:
  + Python 2.7 release series (http://www.python.org/download/releases/)
  + Astropy (http://www.astropy.org/)
  + Mechanize (http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/download.html)
  + Beautiful Soup 4 (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
  + Internet access

If you have pip installed then run:
 $ sudo pip install numpy astropy mechanize beautifulsoup4
to install all of the dependencies.

Usage:
 $ chmod +x ned.py
 $ ./ned.py data.dat
where data.dat is a newline-separated list of Polarisation Catalog entries or NED names.
A sample data.dat is provided.

Note that running the script without any file input:
 $ ./ned.py
will wait for manual data input. To indicate the end of a line of entry hit Return.
To validate the provided input then press Ctrl+D. Otherwise provide more lines of input and
then press Ctrl+D to validate them all. After validation press Ctrl+D again to continue
or provide more lines of input to validate more sources.

If an output filename is specified:
 $ ./ned.py --file out.dat pol.dat
then results will be written to that file. Otherwise results are displayed.

For more information refer to:
 $ ./ned.py --help
