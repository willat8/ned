Requirements:
  + Python 2.7 release series (http://www.python.org/download/releases/)
  + NumPy (http://www.numpy.org/)
  + Astropy (http://www.astropy.org/)
  + Mechanize (http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/download.html)
  + Beautiful Soup 4 (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
  + Internet access

If you have pip installed then run:
 $ sudo pip install numpy astropy mechanize beautifulsoup4
to install all of the dependencies.

Usage:
 $ chmod +x ned.py
 $ ./ned.py data.dat
where data.dat is a newline-separated list of custom input data (with format specified in ned.conf).
Sample dat files are provided.

The output format can be specified in the ned.conf configuration file.
The syntax is a normal python format string. See ned.conf for the available data fields.

The input format can also be specified in ned.conf.
The syntax is a space separated sequence of field names. See ned.conf for automatically recognised field names.

Note that running the script without any file input:
 $ ./ned.py
will wait for manual data input. To indicate the end of a line of entry hit Return and then Ctrl+D.
To indicate the end of input hit Ctrl+D again.

If an output filename is specified:
 $ ./ned.py --file out.dat data.dat
then results will be written to that file. Otherwise results are displayed.

To output a single dat file per input source in plot-ready format use:
 $ ./ned.py --plot dirname data.dat
where dirname is the output directory for the dat files. The output format is:
<rest-frame freq> <NED luminosity in W/Hz> <WISE luminosity in W/Hz> <2MASS luminosity in W/Hz> <GALEX luminosity in W/Hz>

For more information refer to:
 $ ./ned.py --help
